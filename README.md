# What does Anki-Remote do?

It lets you assign any keyboard key to each button on your Flipper Zero and use it as a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) remote. Key mappings are saved to the SD card inside the apps_data folder.

## How to Use

To use the app, simply open it, select **Settings**, and set the key mappings to whatever you want. These settings will be saved to the SD card and will remain the same the next time you open the app.

Then, go back to the main menu, press **Start**, and connect to Bluetooth. Once you're successfully connected, you'll see the controller screen.

## Purpose

The purpose I originally had in mind for this app was to be used as a remote for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a popular spaced repetition flashcard app for med school students. However, this app's usability is not limited to Anki and it **can be used for any other purpose or program**.

The current HID keyboard in the BT remote app is limited for this use case because it takes a long time to navigate to a different button, and you have to be looking at the Flipper's screen at all times to see which key you have selected.
